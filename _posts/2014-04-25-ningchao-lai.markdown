<p class="lead">In the age of information explosion, the transplantation of cultures into one another is continuously occurring, and cultures that were once seemingly different have gradually become similar; the gaps that once existed are now narrowing. This is not only a new age but also a weird age.</p>

<p class="lead">My work combines Chinese and Western cultures, playing with Chinese cultural signifiers and perception. An assumption of culture is first induced and then broken. With the use of fake paper and ink, and calligraphic characters that are in fact pictogram representations of Western concepts, I attempt to reveal the truth with humor and absurdity.</p>

<p class="lead">Thusly questions are opened up: Is seeing believing? What is modern culture? In contemplating these questions, the viewer is led to rethink issues of globalization, materialism and industrialization.</p>
