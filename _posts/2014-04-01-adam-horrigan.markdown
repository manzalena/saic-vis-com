<p class="lead">The work that I will be presenting in the MFA show is a mixed media performance. I have produced 17 paint rollers that have individual letters (or word breaks) cut into their surfaces. I use these rollers to apply a coat of woodblock ink directly to the gallery wall. Each roller is placed within a track that guides the inked roller up the wall. Each roller is used only once. When completed the text will read: THIS MANS WORTH.</p>
