<p class="lead">Hi my name is Magdalena Wistuba and I'm an artist, designer, writer and collaborator. I'm from Santiago, Chile. I live and work in Chicago now, but I used to live in Texas. I'm a bit of a nomad, and I'm interested in the relationship between language and place and in using good design to spread good ideas.</p>
