<p class="lead">The idea underlying MFA project was inspired by people’s shopping behavior and religious worship activities of my friends. As a non-believer, I felt there are lots of similarities between consumption and religion. I considered people addicted to shopping cause on some level it has similar function with religion, they both teach people how to live and behave. The main goal I want to achieve here is create a spiritual environment / experience that’ll enable people attracted to enter another “world”. More specifically, my moving images are going to make people mesmerize / hypnotize in varying degrees. Speaking of images I made, intensional pattern generated from the luxury corporate logotype / imagery (banal / cliche) to elaboration / abstraction / transformation, I attempt to create jewelry-like, mandala feeling compositions which bring more precious and mediative quality to this scenario, and people might also see them as a sardonic view of consumerism widespread over the world, and also as a comment on the need for fetishes.</p>
