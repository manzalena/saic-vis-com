<p class="lead">This body of work explores the documentation of the legacy we leave behind as members of contemporary culture. Participants in the exchange and creation of daily artifacts - both tangible and intangible. Each collage serves to document every tangible material acquired and disposed of on a daily basis. A material is composed as one band of strata in a stratigraphy chart - its size dependent on the amount of time spent with that material. The accompanying book is a work of creative non-fiction that examines the digging, discovery and organization of intangible artifacts - truth and lie, memory and imagination. Together, the works are a representation of what it means to be alive.</p>
