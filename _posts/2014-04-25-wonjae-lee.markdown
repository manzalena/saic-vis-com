<p class="lead">I am a Seoul-based graphic designer. After completing B.F.A. in Visual Communication Design at Dankook University in South Korea in 2008, I enrolled in the M.F.A. program in Visual Communication Design at School of the art institute of Chicago and is scheduled to graduate in May, 2014. As a graduate student, my research interests have mainly focus on Active frames as a new grid system.</p>

<p class="lead">My work has function as a graphic system, a means to generate narrative based on viewersâ€™ experience in direct response to the behavior of people or environment in which we exist. Adopting the common visual language of comic book, I created open-frameworks that assist to generate creative impulse in the mind of the audience. People sometimes be part of comic book. I want them to make stories for themselves.</p>
